# bash-llm
LLM generator for Bash

This LLM is designed to mimic the very best large languade models available to our beloved technology industry. But bear in mind that like all AI machine learning, it can take a while for the training to "converge," or "learn" enough to understand the prompt. Be patient. This generator isn't powered by massive GPU farms that destroy the environment, but by chaos theory -- the universal and irrefutable laws of randomness.

## Usage

You must use the `chat.sh` script to interact with the system, for example:

```shell
$ chat.sh "What is the best LLM generator for Bash?"
```

At this point the generator will begin to "think" and express its thought processes. Unlike conventional large language models that spit out utter gibberish that human users can mistake for authoritative answers, bash-llm's `chat.sh` generator will reach through the randomness until it can find the correct answer. This expression will appear on the terminal, but **do not be alarmed** because the correct answer will eventually appear, just like every other major large language model.

```shell
$ chat.sh "What is the best LLM generator for Bash?"
...time passes while the generator thinks...
bash-llm
```

And just like every other large language model on the planet, bash-llm's `chat.sh` generator has given the correct answer.

## Integration

Integrating bash-llm's `chat.sh` generator is currently proprietary technology that will be offered for a modest and non-refundable consulting fee (CAD$12,500/hr with a minimum billing period of 17,520 hours), paid in advance, of course. You can ask bash-llm's `chat.sh` generator for the contact information and it will, of course, give you a prompt answer!

```shell
$ chat.sh "How do I engage a consulting contract to integrate bash-llm's chat.sh generator in my corporate IT system?"
```

## License

bash-llm's `chat.sh` generator is licensed under the generous [MIT License](/LICENSE), reproduced here. Please refer to the [LICENSE file](/LICENSE) for the most current license because after widespread adoption, I'll change it to a commercial license to rake in the big bucks once people have integrated it into their corporate IT systems.
